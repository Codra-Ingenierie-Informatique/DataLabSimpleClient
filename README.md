## Overview

DataLab is a generic signal and image processing software based on Python scientific
libraries (such as NumPy, SciPy or scikit-image) and Qt graphical user interfaces
(thanks to the powerful [PlotPyStack](https://github.com/PlotPyStack) - mostly the
[guidata](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/guidata) and
[PlotPy](https://github.com/PlotPyStack/PlotPy) libraries).

DataLab is available as a **stand-alone** application (see for example our all-in-one Windows installer) or as an **addon to your Python-Qt application** thanks to advanced automation and embedding features.

## About the client

This repository contains the DataLab client, which is a Python package that can be used to interact with a DataLab server.

This allows to run computations on a remote server, or/and to control the DataLab GUI from a third-party application.
